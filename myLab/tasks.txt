---------- CHAPTER #1 - HTML & CSS ---------
task #1 - create three html files and link them

task #2 - style one of your html files with css (heading, button, background)

task #3 - build a grid for your index.html file using bootstrap (container, row, col)
          your page should, ultimately, have:
          - a background image
          - a main container covering the entire page with some whitespace left and right
          - a header with links to the other two pages
          - three div containers with unique ids!
                - div container one with the text 'all galleries'
                - div container two with the text 'all items in gallery'
                - div container three with the text 'selected item'

task #4 - implement a bootstrap navbar

task #5 - piece everything together and add a table with three rows to the first container



---------- JS ---------
the reason why we do js only now and why we were doing so much html, css, and bootstrap was so that you get a good understanding of what the DOM is.

task #6 - topic: console.log
          create main.js file and embed it into index.html
          in main.js console.log('test')
          open the website in chrome and open the developer tools (ctrl shift j in windows, ctrl option j on mac)

task #7 - topic: js functions
          write the console log into a function and call that function

task #8 - topic: event listener
          create a button in the 'all galleries' div
          add an event listener to the button that fires the function on click

task #9 - topic: selectors
          in the function, instead of just logging a message, grab a div container and hide it.

task #10 - create all three buttons with proper functionality of hiding and showing.
           the hierarchy of the structure is as follows:
           #1 all galleries, #2 selected gallery, #3 selected item
           ultimately, you will have three different buttons for three different functionalities, i.e. 'show all items of this gallery', 'show item', and a 'back' button on the lowest and the second lvl;

task #11 - forEach loops

task #12 - getting the Harvard Museum API and using it
           write a fetch request and check out the data structure
